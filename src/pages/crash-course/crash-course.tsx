				<h2>Course Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Like the word says, &quot;fem&quot;
					means means feminine and &quot;boy&quot;
					means male. A femboy is a human male
					that expresses himself in a typically
					feminine manner. Often by choice of
					clothing, mannerisms, hairstyle,
					hobbies, or any activity or behaviour
					usually associated with the female
					female gender.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you can see, this doesn&apos;t mean
					that being a femboy comes with a defined
					sexuality, personality or any other
					trait, other than being girly boy!
				</p>

				<h2>How to identify a wild femboy</h2>
				<p>
					First and foremost, identifying a femboy
					might not be as hard as you think. While
					it is true that they have distinct dress
					code, they usually do not advertise it
					in any way. Hence they can also have an
					introverted, shy personality. Remember
					that femboys are also people!
				</p>
				<p>
					Also remember that because of S O C I E
					T Y, not all femboys choose to exhibit
					the most typical signs of identifying a
					femboy, choosing to keep the
					&quot;femboyism&quot; a secret.
					We&apos;ll see this in more detail
					ahead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are a few specific tip you can use
					to identify a femboy:
				</p>
				<table>
					<tbody>
						<tr className="caution">
							<td>Clothes</td>
							<td>
								Femboys can often choose clothing
								typically associated with
								femininity, such as dresses,
								skirts, blouses, or other garments
								that may be considered
								traditionally feminine. But this
								is not always the case.
							</td>
							<td>
								Some femboys prefer to keep their
								femininity to themselves for any
								reason. Resulting in them choosing
								a more neutral and androgynous set
								of clothes like oversized hoodies,
								cargo pants, or anything that is
								not traditionally gendered.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<p />
						<tr className="caution">
							<td>Mannerisms and behavior</td>
							<td>
								They may exhibit mannerisms or
								behaviors that are perceived as
								traditionally feminine, such as
								gestures, speech patterns, or body
								language.
							</td>
							<td>
								Other femboys might exhibit more
								masculine paterns of behaviour.
								Remember that the behaviour that
								we traddionally call feminine is
								not a defined set of behaviours,
								but rather depend on customs, so
								femboys from different parts of
								the world will behave differently
							</td>
						</tr>
						<p />
						<tr className="caution">
							<td>Hairstyle and Grooming</td>
							<td>
								Femboys may prefer hairstyles or
								grooming practices that are
								associated with femininity, such
								as long hair, haircuts typically
								seen as girly, subtle makeup,
								skincare or manicured nails.
							</td>
							<td>
								Nowadays however, a lot of femboys
								might try to keep their general
								looks manly because changes on
								hair or their skin are more
								permanent and noticeable than just
								swapping clothing, with no room
								for hiding.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<p />
						<tr className="caution">
							<td>
								Interest in feminine activities
							</td>
							<td>
								They may have interests or hobbies
								that are traditionally associated
								with femininity, such as fashion,
								makeup, or activities typically
								considered &quot;girly.&quot;
								However, femboys can totally have
								masculine interests as well! Being
								a femboys is not a strict label.
								They can like posting edgy memes,
								cars, weapons and any other
								typically masculine activites.
							</td>
							<td>
								So, we can conclude that liking
								certain activites doesn&apos;t
								make you or anyone else less of a
								femboy and that we shouldn&apos;t
								assume identities. But we can
								still have fun classifying
								ourselves.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<p />
						<tr className="caution">
							<td>Self-Identification</td>
							<td>
								Ultimately, the most reliable way
								to identify a femboy is through
								self-identification. If an
								individual identifies as a femboy,
								respect their identity
								accordingly.
							</td>
