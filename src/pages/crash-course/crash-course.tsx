				<h2>
					CHAPTER 1: Introduction to basic
					concepts
				</h2>
				<p>
					Before we teach you what it means to be
					submissive and breedable. We are going
					to learn some core concepts that we are
					going to be using forward.
				</p>
				<p>Sex:</p>
				<p>
					Used to refer to the biological
					attributes that determine whether you
					are a male, female or intersex.
					Genitals, chromosomes, etc. In Gender
					Studies, we will be using it to refer to
					what an individual is assigned at birth.
					Usually male, Assigned Male At Birth
					(AMAB) or female, Assigned Female At
					Birth (AFAB).
				</p>
				<p>Gender:</p>
				<p>
					Gender is how you understand yourself
					internally. It is based on how you feel,
					what you think yourself as, the ideas
					you live your life around, but not how
					others label you. So, technically
					speaking, gender can be anything.
				</p>
				<p>Gender Expression:</p>
				<p>
					Is the way you present yourself and what
					you expect others to perceive you as.
					This is determined by clothes,
					mannerisms, voice, hairstyle, etc.
				</p>
				<p>Sexuality:</p>
				<p>
					Refers to how a person experiences and
					expresses sexual and romantic
					attraction. In this course, we will be
					using it as is how you label your
					pattern of attraction: heterosexual,
					homosexual, bisexual, asexual, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why does learning these concepts
					matters?
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of the constant confusion and
					stigma there is about the subject around
					the world. So understanding these can
					help you build your own identity better
					and understand other people better too.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className="section">
				<h2>
					CHAPTER 2: Introduction to Femboys and
					other concepts and questions
				</h2>
				<p>So, what is a femboy?</p>
				<p>
					Like the word says, &quot;fem&quot;
					means means feminine and &quot;boy&quot;
					means male. So, for general purposes, we
					will define a femboy like a human that
					was AMAB and expresses his gender in a
					feminine way. Often by choice, however
					it can happen accidentally too. As can
					see, the definition doesn&apos;t mean
					anything in respect to gender or sexual
					attraction.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the same way, we can find other
					definitions. For example:
				</p>
				<p>What is a woman?</p>
				<p>
					A person that was Assigned Female At
					Birth
				</p>
				<p>What is a tomboy?</p>
				<p>
					A person that was Assigned Female At
					Birth and expresses her gender identity
					in a masculine way
				</p>
				<p>What is a trans woman?</p>
				<p>
					A person that was Assigned Male At Birth
					and genders herself as female.
				</p>
				<p>What is a boymodder?</p>
				<p>
					A person that was Assigned Male At
					Birth, genders herself as female but
					expresses her gender identity in a
					masculine way.
				</p>
				<p>What is a trans woman?</p>
				<p>
					A person that was Assigned Male At Birth
					and genders herself as female.
				</p>
				<p>And we can go on and go on.</p>
				<p>
					But, wait a second! if I can gender
					myself as anything I want, and that
					affects every term you&apos;ve presented
					before, can I just name myself one thing
					today and another tomorrow?
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes. Remember that struggle with
					identity is something that every person
					has gone through, one way or another.
					Additionally, remember our side note.
					The whole point of this course is to
					teach you these concepts and motivate
					you to use your own critical thinking to
					use said concepts. Even though these
					ideas were put together with the intent
					of explaining gender and sex nowadays,
					it is ultimately you who decides how to
					use these concepts. And like any ideas,
					these are open to criticism and change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wait a second second! I am a trans man
					and I am a real man. I don&apos;t agree
					with saying that a man is someone who
					doesn&apos;t gender themselves as a man.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just like any set of ideas, these are
					prone to change, depending on the
					society they are. There is no much sense
					in defining what a femboy is for a
					Sixteenth century french soldier. If you
					would change the definition to &quot;A
					person that was Assigned Female At Birth
					and genders himself as male&quot; or
					simply &quot;A person that genders
					themself as male&quot; because you think
					it&apos;s a better representative of the
					world you live in, don&apos;t be
					intimidated or offended by a different
					definition. Instead be open to dialogue!
				</p>
				<p>But... What about pronouns?</p>
				<p>
					Any person, in the internet or in real
					life, can be called names they are not
					going to like, independently of their
					gender, sex, race, nationality, etc. If
					someone uses prefered pronouns, the
					decision to use them comes down to
					respect.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to be respected, act
					respectfully!
				</p>
				<p>
					Don&apos;t be an asshole! Respect
					people&apos;s pronouns!

					CHAPTER 3: Becoming a femboy! Basics!
					Skincare, diet and basic bodily care
				</h2>
				<p>
					Enough boring sociology talk! Let&apos;s
					do something more fun!
				</p>
				<p>
					But before becoming a femboy, we need to
					learn what&apos;s beneath of a femboy.
					Under all the
					slutty/cute/revealing/fabulous clothes
					you&apos;ll be wearing, you&apos;ll
					still be a person that needs to take
					care of their body.
				</p>
				<p>
					Luckily for us, most of the knowledge we
					need has already been discovered! So you
					can find more about each respective
					subject by doing your own research.
				</p>
				<p>SKINCARE:</p>
				<p>Why is skincare important?</p>
				<p>
					Because it will keep your skin clear and
					smooth. Not to mention, reduce oiliness,
					dryness, acne and other imperfections.
					And, improves the look of makeup!
				</p>
				<p>And because it&apos;s healthy!</p>
				<p>
					We&apos;ll show you a very basic, easy
					to replicate skincare routine you can
					start since now!
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cleansing (Washing your face)</li>
					<p>
						Don&apos;t use common dishwasher soap!
						The skin in your face is delicate! Use
						a especialized face cleanser.
					</p>
					<p>
						How do I do it? Put a little of the
						cleanser on your fingers and wash your
						face rubbing in circular motions for
						about 30 seconds, but don&apos;t scrub
						too hard!
					</p>
					<p>
						What do I use? Preferably use lukewarm
						water, cold water is alright, just
						never too hot!
					</p>
					<p>
						When do I do it? Once when you wake up
						in the morning and once before
						sleeping
					</p>
					<p>
						What kind of cleanser should I buy?
						The type of cleanser you should use
						depends on your type of skin.
						Cleansers are usually advertized for
						specifics kinds of skin: Oily, dry,
						sensitive, normal or a combination of
						the previous. The name are pretty
						self-explanatories. And, in case of
						combinated skin, use a cleanser that
						covers the majority of your face.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not only your face, don&apos;t forget
						the upper part of your neck!
					</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Exfoliating (Cleaning your face)
					</li>
					<p>
						Exfoliating removes the dead skin that
						accumulates over time. Have you ever
						heard your skin changes every couple
						of years? Well, it doesn&apos;t go
						away on its own, we have to remove it!
					</p>
					<p>
						When do I do it? Usually, it is done
						after 2 or 3 days since overdoing can
						remove important bacteria in your
						pretty face, just like overcleansing.
						But you can also experiment to find
						the timeframe that fits your desired
						results.
					</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Moisturizing (Hydrating your face)
					</li>
					<p>
						Just like cleanser, buy a especialized
						moisturizer for your skin and
						experiment with products you see
						results with!
					</p>
					<p>
						When do I do it? Right after washing
						your face
					</p>
					<p>
						How much? You will have to experiment
						with what feels right for your skin.
						Usually, use the amount that makes you
						feel refreshed. All kinds are
						different!
					</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Sunscreening (Protecting your face)
					</li>
					<p>
						Finally, time to shield your pretty
						face from the UV light from the
						outside.
					</p>
					<p>
						When do I do it? Once every morning
						for skincare purposes. If you live in
						a really sunny place, everytime you go
						outside. And not only in your face;
						arms, legs, hands and any part that
						might be exposed to the sun for
						prolonged periods of time
					</p>
					<p>
						What kind of protection? Suncreen is
						sold by SPF protection. Usually a SPF
						of 50 is enough. But if sun is not
						super strong where you live, you can
						use one of 30.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you&apos;re going to spend long
						periods of time in the sun, it might
						not be a bad idea to carry some of
						your sunscreen to re-apply it.
					</p>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Remember skincare is a routine, not a
					miracle! You will not see results
					overnight!
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, don&apos;t forget to make
					your own research! We haven&apos;t
					delved into the most famous products and
					extra beauty products, like serum and
					toner, because they will be part of your
					own enthusiastic findings to become the
					best version of yourself!
				</p>
				<p>DIET:</p>
				<p>Why is important to have a diet?</p>
				<p>
					Because if you have reached this point
					of the course, you probably have an
					image in mind of what you want to body
					to look like. And exercise does helps
					getting a healthy body, but the food you
					eat everyday helps more!
				</p>
				<p>
					Usually, keeping your meals to three a
					day and avoiding copious amounts of junk
					food works just fine. Especially if you
					do some kind of physical activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since dieting and caloric intake is an
					another theme entirely, we won&apos;t
					deal with it here. But we will give you
					some tips to improve yourself dietary
					wise.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Avoid binge/depression/anxiety eating
						as much as you can. If you need help,
						don&apos;t be scared to ask for
						psychological help.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep your diet balanced, it
						doesn&apos; have to be perfect. You
						can have a snack here and there, as
						long you don&apos;t do it frequently.
					</li>
					<li>
						Consider doing a physical activity!
						Sports are a great way to get you
						invested and excited about it, but any
						activity will do! Gymnastic,
						stretches, yoga, running, hiking,
						cycling, anything that makes you move!
					</li>
					<li>
						Stay hydrated! Drink the necessary
						amount of water during the day.
					</li>
					<li>
						Listen to your body! The goal of being
						a femboy shouldn&apos;t starve you!
						But also make sure you&apos;re not
						eating if you don&apos;t need to.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>DEALING WITH BODY HAIR:</p>
				<p>
					You will probably want to remove all of
					it, or at the very least, from your
					face, arms and legs.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will probably feel that you need to
					remove all of it, or at the very least,
					from your face, arms and legs. But it
					truly depends on your personal
					preference and how thick your body hair
					is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let&apos;s start with razors. Shaving
					could be a tedious task, depending on
					how fast your hair grows. And depending
					on how thick your hair is, you might not
					need to shave completely.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider including a trimmer in your
					inventory. If your hair grows extremely
					quickly or it&apos;s the first time you
					shave, a trimmer can cut the hair to
					manageable length.
				</p>
				<p>
					When it comes to shaving, depending on
					the orientation of your hair, you can
					shave with it or against it. Shaving
					against the hair (or against the grain)
					can give you the smoothest result, but
					there is a higher chance you cut
					yourself. While going with it, might
					leave some hair that the razor could not
					catch. For most people, starting with
					one shave with the grain, and then one
					shave against it gets a consistent
					smooth result.
				</p>
				<p>
					How do I do it? Use a shaving cream and
					warm water. After cleaning the area you
					want to shave, use your trimmer if you
					have one. Then, you&apos;ll want to
					apply some shaving cream in the area and
					cut with the grain, then a second time
					against the grain.
				</p>
				<p>
					The skin is a very sensitive organ, so
					don&apos;t push the razor against your
					skin. You might feel that it makes it
					work better, but it does NOT! It only
					hurts your skin and makes you more
					likely to get cut.
				</p>
				<p>
					What do I use? There is no need of
					buying women&apos;s razors to shave,
					they&apos;re not really that different
					from the men&apos;s ones and
					they&apos;re usually more expensive. For
					shaving creams, some people like the
					mentol feeling in their face and body,
					we would recommend a more gentle one
					(natural ingredients like aloe vera) if
					it&apos;s your first time shaving. And
					PLEASE don&apos;t use mentolated or
					cooling cream in your nether regions!
					But you can use it in pretty much the
					rest of your body, just beware any
					irration or allergic reaction! And DO
					NOT use soap to shave instead of shaving
					cream. Your skin will get damaged and
					you will get cut more often.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have the money or the act of
					shaving is too tedious, there are other
					more expensive alternatives. Like
					epilating, waxing and laser hair
					removal. In my experience (yes, the
					author&apos;s experience), waxing at
					home is ineffective and I recommend
					doing it at an established store that
					fits your needs. Not only that, but
					they&apos;re also more effective methods
					and more permanent. Since there&apos;s
					not really much else we can tell you to
					do especifically, other than ask for
					prices and follow the instructions they
					give you, we&apos;ll leave it to you to
					find out about more about these three
					methods.

					CHAPTER 4: Becoming a femboy! Glow up!
					Clothes, hair and mannerisms
				</h2>
				<p>
					Final and funniest chapter! Be ready to
					find your style as a femboy!
				</p>
				<p>CLOTHES:</p>
				<p>
					Now we have the goal of dressing pretty
					and femboyant. Just like there are
					infinite clothing styles, there are
					infinite ways of dressing femboyish! You
					have to find your style and find what
					suits you!
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are some clothing items that any
					femboy needs to have:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Skirts:</li>
					<p>They feel cute and give u breeze!</p>
					<li>High thighs:</li>
					<p>To accentuate your legs!</p>
					<li>Choker:</li>
					<p>Something to snap~</p>
					<li>Oversized hoodie:</li>
					<p>To feel warm and cozy!</p>
				</ul>
				<p>HAIR:</p>
				<p>
					For now, try to looks for hairstyles you
					might like and would look good on you.
					Not everyone can pull off long straight
					hair or a tomboy haircut, look into a
					mirror and try brushing your hair,
					playing with it until you get an idea of
					what you want.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shampoo: Essential to keep your hair
					clean. Most of the time, you actually
					don&apos;t want to use it everyday,
					because it might damage your scalp.
					Using it still depends on your
					particular hair. Usually, you can use it
					every other day. Remember to focus on
					your scalp and not the hair itself when
					applying.
				</p>
				<p>
					Conditioner: Essential to keep your hair
					healthy. You can use it everyday,
					focusing on the hair instead of the
					scalp. Leaving for 1 minute and washing
					with cold water.
				</p>
				<p>MANNERISMS:</p>
				<p>
					If you have read everything up until
					this point, just be yourself. We&apos;re
					sure there&apos;s enough gay in you.
